**Blackjack 4000 Blackjack Betting Simulator**

The purpose of this simulation is to simulate 3 major blackjack betting strategies 
with a control strategy in order to determine whether the strategies are statistically 
different from each other over a large number of runs, and then ranking the best strategies
according to profitability.

The strategies simulated are the Martingale strategy, the Manhattan (2-1-2) strategy,
the Oscar's Grind strategy, and a "safe" strategy where the player only ever makes 
the minimum bet per hand. All players use the basic play strategy that can be found at 
the wikipedia article for Blackjack. The dealer uses a modified version of this strategy.
